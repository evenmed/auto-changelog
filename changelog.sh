# Automatic Changelog Generator
#
# Version 2.0.0
#
# Description:
# This script takes care of updating the Changelog.md file with the latest
# commits whenever we push into main, and also updating the version both in the
# Changelog and in package.json, in accordance with what's described in the
# Changelog.README.md file.
#
# It consists of 4 steps:
#
# 1. Get the commits to add to the changelog. This is done by `git log`ing the 100
#    most recent commits' messages and then checking each one to see if:
#
#    a. They are already in the changelog, in which case we assume all prior
#       commits are too and stop the loop
#    b. If they start with an emoji that isn't any of the excluded ones
#    
#    If a. is false and b. is true, we push that commit into the list of commits
#    to be added into the changelog.
#
#    IMPORTANT: In order for the `git log` to work, the checkout step in the action
#    YAML file must have a "fetch-depth: 0". Otherwise the log will only return the
#    single most recent commit.
#
# 2. Calculate the new version number based on commits' emojis. We split the list
#    of commits to add into 3:
#
#    - *Breaking Changes* are all commits that start with a "üö®"
#    - *Features* are all commits that start with a "‚ú®"
#    - *Patches* are all other commits
#
#    If there are any Breaking Changes, we do a MAJOR version bump. If there aren't
#    any Breaking Changes but there are any Features, we do a MINOR bump. If they're
#    all patches, we do a PATCH version bump.
#
# 3. Update the Changelog! We generate a string to be added at the top of the
#    changelog in the following format:
#    
#    **vX.X.X YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM**
#    ...All breaking changes
#    ...All new features
#    ...All patches
#
#    Once that's done, we add it into the top of the Changelog file. Additionally,
#    we also update the version in package.json during this step
#
#
# Potential issues:
# 1. If we repeat identical commit messages, eg:
#    - An old commit with msg "üêû Fixed bug"
#    - A new commit with msg "üêû Fixed bug"
#    It will find the new one in the changelog and thus consider that it was
#    added, skipping it and any prior commits
# 
# 2. We only check the 100 most recent commits, so if more than 100 commits are
#    made without updating the changelog, the surplus won't get added
#
# 3. This is only triggered when pushing to main, meaning dev won't get the
#    changelog updates unless we downmerge / rebase. This also means that if we
#    manually commit any changes into the changelog in dev, we'll likely have a
#    conflict when merging into main
#
# 4. Since this script is triggered by a push into main and it also pushes into
#    main itself, there's the danger of creating an infinite action loop. Per
#    initial tests, it seems that the push from this action doesn't trigger the
#    action, probably thanks to a safeguard from Github for this exact scenario.
#    Additionally, if it did get triggered a 2nd time, it shouldn't find any new
#    commits to add into the Changelog and thus not get triggered a third time.
